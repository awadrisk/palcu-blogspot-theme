Don't ask why I chose Blogger in the first place. Original theme was configured with Blogger Template Designer.

## Some tricks used for customizing
* added Open Graph tags
* using `<b:if cond='data:blog.url == 'some_url'></b:if>` for description and keyword tags for every post
* added Facebook comments _(facebook initialiazation script is loaded only for post pages, for a more slim homepage)_
* custom quotes in the footer _[TODO: move them in an external script]_

## Plugins
* Twitter Box, with tweets cached as cookies _[TODO: use localstorage]_
* Google Plus box
* Github badge
* Facebook recommendations box
