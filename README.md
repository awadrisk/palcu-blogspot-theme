Don't ask why I chose Blogger in the first place. Original theme was configured with Blogger Template Designer.

## Some tricks used for customizing
* added Open Graph tags
* using `<b:if cond='data:blog.url == 'some_url'></b:if>` for description and keyword tags for every post
* added Facebook comments, for posts
* custom quotes in the footer [TODO: move them in an external script]
